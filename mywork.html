    <li>I successfully completed a project on MACHINE LEARNING in association with one of my professors 
        where the ML model was suppossed to check the fraudulency rate of the credit cards. The project 
        was a great success.

        I completed an offline internship program from the government association Bharat Sanchar Nigam
        Limited (BSNL) in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand. Dusring the tenure of my internship I learnt the various
        technical layers of telecommunication field. It was a great learning experience.

    <li>
        Took part in various coding contests which were held in many online coding platforms.

    <li>
        As part of a team effort, I contributed to the development of a C++ based simulation 
        of a simplified operating system kernel. 
        In this project, I played a key role in implementing process 
        scheduling, memory management, and file system functionalities.
         Rigorous testing and debugging were performed to ensure the stability and efficiency of the 
         system. The project allowed me to grasp the intricacies of operating systems and gain hands-on
          experience with low-level programming.
