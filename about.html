    <p>
      Hello! My name is Pritisha Giri, and I am a passionate and driven web developer with a strong
      background in front-end technologies. I love creating clean, user-friendly, and visually
      appealing websites that leave a positive impact on users.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have extensive experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am always eager to learn
      new technologies and frameworks to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. I have
      worked on various projects, both independently and as part of a team, which has honed my
      problem-solving and collaboration skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside my technical skills, I am an excellent communicator and can easily convey complex
      ideas to non-technical stakeholders. I thrive in fast-paced environments and enjoy taking
      on challenges that push me to grow both personally and professionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, reading science fiction
      novels, or experimenting with new cooking recipes. I believe in a healthy work-life balance
      and am always seeking ways to maintain it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently looking for new opportunities to contribute my skills and creativity to a
      forward-thinking company. If you think I could be a valuable addition to your team, feel free
      to get in touch!
