    <h1>SKILLS</h1>
   <h3> Throughout my academic pursuits and personal projects, I have gained proficiency in a range of programming languages, including Python, Java, and C++. I have leveraged Python's versatility to develop web applications, analyze data, and implement machine learning models. My experience with Java has involved developing backend systems and utilizing frameworks such as Spring to build robust applications.
</h3><br>
<h3>In web development, I am adept at using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive and visually appealing websites. I have also explored React.js, a popular JavaScript library, to build interactive user interfaces that deliver a seamless browsing experience.
<br>
Database management is another area of expertise, and I have worked extensively with SQL and MySQL to design and manipulate databases efficiently. Additionally, I am familiar with version control systems such as Git, which enables me to collaborate effectively with other developers and track changes to projects.
